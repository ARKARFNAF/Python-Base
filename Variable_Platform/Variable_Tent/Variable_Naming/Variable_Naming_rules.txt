    What are the rules of naming variables?

1. A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.
   Examples:
   test = "example"         ✓
   _test = "example"        ✓

2. A variable name cannot start with a number, but it can contain a number.
   Examples:
   1test = "example"        ✗
   test1 = "example"        ✓

3. A variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
   No special characters are allowed.
   Examples:
   test1_1 = "example"      ✓
   test$ = "example"        ✗

4. No spaces are allowed in variable names.
   Example:
   test 1 = "example"       ✗

5. Variable names are case-sensitive.
   This means "name" and "Name" are treated as different variables.

6. Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.
   Examples:
   if = "example"           ✗
   True = "example"         ✗
   class = "example"        ✗

7. Descriptive names should be used for better readability.
   Example:
   player_name = "Oose"     ✓
   x = "Oose"               ✗
